<h2><a id="ETCHING"></a>ETCHING DAGUERREOTYPE PLATES.</h2>

<h3>BY W. R. GROVE.</h3>

<p>Dr. Berres of Vienna was the first, I believe,
who published a process for etching
Daguerreotypes; his method was to cover
the plates with a solution of gum-arabic,
and then to immerse them in nitric acid of
a certain strength. I have not seen any
plates thus prepared, but the few experiments
which I have made with nitric acid,
have given me a burred and imperfect outline;
and I have experienced extreme difficulty
of manipulation from the circumstance
of the acid never attacking the plate
uniformly and simultaneously. My object,
however, in this communication, is not to
find fault with a process which I have
never perhaps fairly tried or seen tried by
experienced hands, and the inventor of
which deserves the gratitude of all interested
in physical science; but to make public
another which possesses the advantage of
extreme simplicity, which any one, however
unskilled in chemical manipulation,
may practise with success, and which produces
a perfect etching of the original
image; so much so, that a plate thus etched
can scarcely be distinguished from an
actual Daguerreotype, preserving all the
microscopic delicacy of the finest parts of
the impression.</p>

<p>One sentence will convey the secret of
this process; it is to make the Daguerreotype
the anode<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> of a voltaic combination,
in a solution which will not of itself attack
either silver or mercury, but of which,
when electrolyzed, the anion will attack
these metals unequally. This idea occurred
to me soon after the publication of
Daguerre's process; but, being then in the
country, and unable to procure any plates,
I allowed the matter to sleep; and other
occupations prevented for some time any
recurrence to it. Recently having heard
much conversation as to the practicability
or impracticability of Daguerreotype engraving,
I became anxious to try a few experiments
in pursuance of my original notion;
and for this purpose applied in several
quarters for Daguerreotypes; but, thanks
to the exclusiveness of M. Daguerre's patent,
I found that to procure a sufficient
number of plates for any reasonable chance
of success, was quite out of the question.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> Strictly speaking, this is a misapplication of
Faraday's term; he applied it to the surface of
the electrotype; as, however, all continental, and
many English writers (among whom I may name
Whewell) have applied it to the positive electrode,
and as an expression is most needed for
that, I have not hesitated so to apply it.</p></div>

<p>On mentioning the subject to Mr. Gassiot,
he, with his usual energy and liberality,
offered to procure me a sufficiency of
Daguerreotypes; and it is owing to his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
zealous and valuable co&ouml;peration that I
have been able to get such definite results
as appear worth publication.</p>

<p>Five points naturally present themselves
to the consideration of the experimenter on
this subject: first, the quantity of the voltaic
current; secondly, its intensity; thirdly,
the distance between the anode and
cathode; fourthly, the time during which
the process should be continued; and fifthly,
the solution to be employed.</p>

<p>1st. With regard to the first element or
quantity, many previous experiments had
convinced me that, to give the maximum
and most uniform quantitative<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> action of
any voltaic combination, the electrodes
should be of the same size as the generating
plates; in other words, that the sectional
area of the electrolyte should be the
same throughout the whole voltaic circuit.
It seems strange that this point should
have been so generally overlooked as it
has been; an electrician would never form
a battery, one pair of plates of which were
smaller than the rest; and yet the electrodes,
which offering of themselves a resistance
to the current, from the inoxidability
of the anode, are, <i>a fortiori</i>, a restriction
when of small size, have generally been
formed indefinitely smaller than the gene,
rating plates; I, therefore, without further
experiment, applied this principle to the
process about to be detailed.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> I say the quantitative action; for where
great intensity is required, as in decomposing alkalies,
&amp;c., it may be advisable to narrow the
electrodes, so as to present a smaller surface for
the reaction of the liberated elements.</p></div>

<p>2nd. <i>The intensity of the voltaic current.</i>&mdash;Here
it appeared to me that, as in
the electrotype, where the visible action is
at the cathode, a certain degree of intensity
throws down metal as a crystal, an increased
intensity as a metallic plate, and a further
intensity as a pulverulent mass; that degree
of intensity which would show on the negative
deposit the finest impressions from the
cathode, would also produce on the anode
the most delicate excavations, and consequently,
an intensity which would just fall
short of the point of evolving oxygen from
the plate to be etched, would be the most
likely to succeed; this point was not, however,
adopted without careful experiment,
the more so, as in one instance Mr. Gassiot
succeeded in procuring a very fair etching
with a series of ten pairs of the nitric acid
battery; however, the results of repeated
experiments, in which the intensity has
been varied from a series of sixteen pairs to
one of the nitric acid battery, were strongly
in favor of the above idea, and, consequently,
went to prove that one pair gives
the most efficient degree of intensity for
the purpose required.</p>

<p>3rd. <i>The distance between the plates.</i>&mdash;As
it was proved by De la Rive, that in an
electrolytic solution, when the electrodes
are at a distance, the action extends a
little beyond the parallel lines which would
join the bounds of the electrodes, and thus,
that the current as it were diverges and
converges, it appeared advisable to approximate
the electrodes as nearly as possible,
so as to produce uniformity of action
over the whole plate. Provided a solution
be used which does not evolve gas at the
cathode, I am inclined to think that the
plates may be with advantage indefinitely
approximated; but as this was not the case
with the solution I selected for the greater
number of experiments, 0&middot;2 of an inch was
fixed on as the distance, in order that the
gas evolved from the cathode should not
adhere to the anode, and thus interfere
with the action.</p>

<p>4th. <i>Time of continuing the operation.</i>&mdash;This
was a matter only to be decided by
experiment, and must vary for the voltaic
combination and solution employed. With
a single pair of the nitric acid battery, from
twenty-five to thirty seconds, was after a
great number of experiments, fixed on as
the proper time; and as the plate may at
any period be removed from the solution
and examined, the first experiment should
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
never exceed twenty-five seconds, when, if
not complete, the plate may be again subjected
to electrolysis.</p>

<p>5th. <i>The solution to be employed.</i>&mdash;Here
a vast field was open, and still is open to
future experimentalists. Admitting the
usual explanation of the Daguerreotype,
which supposes the light parts to be mercury,
and the dark silver, the object was to
procure a solution which would attack one
of these, and leave the other untouched.
If one could be found to attack the silver
and not the mercury, so much the better,
as this would give a positive engraving, or
one with lights and shadows, as in nature,
while the converse would give a negative
one. Unfortunately, silver and mercury
are nearly allied in their electrical relations.
I made several experiments with
pure silver and mercury, used as the anode
of a voltaic combination, but found that
any solution which would act on one, acted
also on the other. All then that could be
expected, was a difference of action. With
the Daguerreotype plates I have used the
following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Dilute sulphuric acid, dilute hydrochloric
acid, solution of sulphate of copper, of potash,
and of acetate of lead. The object of
using acetate of lead, was the following:&mdash;
With this solution peroxide of lead is precipitated
upon the anode; and, this substance
being insoluble in nitric acid, it was
hoped that the pure silver parts of the
plate, being more closely invested with a
stratum of peroxide than the mercurialized
portions, these latter would, when immersed
in this menstruum, be attacked,
and thus furnish a negative etching. I
was also not altogether without hopes of
some curious effects, from the color of the
thin films thus thrown down; here, however,
I was disappointed; the colors succeeded
each other as much as in the steel
plate used for the metallochrome; but
With inferior lustre. On immersion in
nitric acid of different degrees of dilution,
the plates were unequally attacked, and
the etching burred and imperfect. Of the
other solutions, hydrochloric acid was,
after many experiments, fixed on as decidedly
the best; indeed, this I expected,
from the strong affinity of chlorine for
silver.</p>

<p>I will now describe the manipulation
which has been employed by Mr. Gassiot,
and myself, in the laboratory of the London
Institution, with very uniform success.
A wooden frame is prepared, having two
grooves at 0&middot;2 of an inch distance, into
which can be slid the plate to be etched,
and a plate of platinum of the same size.
To ensure a ready and equable evolution of
hydrogen, this latter is platinized after Mr.
Smee's method; for, if the hydrogen adhere
to any part of the cathode, the opposite
portions of the anode are proportionably
less acted on. The back and edges of the
Daguerreotype are varnished with a solution
of shell-lac, which is scraped off one
edge to admit of metallic connexion being
established. The wooden frame with its
two plates is now fitted into a vessel of
glass of porcelain, filled with a solution of
two measures hydrochloride acid, and one
distilled water, (sp. gr. 1.1), and two stout
platinum wires, proceeding from a single
pair of the nitric acid battery, are made to
touch the edges of the plates, while the assistant
counts the time; this, as before
stated, should not exceed thirty seconds.
When the plate is removed from the acid, it
should be well rinsed with distilled water;
and will now (if the metal be homogeneous)
present a beautiful sienna-colored drawing
of the original design, produced by a film
of the oxychloride formed;&mdash;it is then placed
in an open dish containing a very weak
solution of ammonia, and the surface
gently rubbed with, very soft cotton, until
all the deposit is dissolved; as soon as this
is effected, it should be instantly removed,
plunged into distilled water, and carefully
dried. The process is now complete, and
a perfect etching of the original design will
be observed; this, when printed from, gives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
a positive picture, or one which has its
lights and shadows as in nature; and
which is, in this respect, more correct than
the original Daguerreotype as the sides are
not inverted; printing can therefore be directly
read, and in portraits thus taken, the
right and left sides of the face are in their
proper position. There is, however, <i>ex
necessitate rei</i>, this difficulty, with respect
to prints from Daguerreotypes,&mdash;if the
plates be etched to a depth sufficient to produce
a very distinct impression, some of
the finer lines of the original must inevitably
run into each other, and thus the chief
beauty of these exquisite images be destroyed.
If, on the other hand, the process
be only continued long enough to leave an
exact etching of the original design, which
can be done to the minutest perfection, the
very cleaning of the plate by the printer
destroys its beauty; and the molecules of
the printing ink being larger than the depth
of the etchings, an imperfect impression
is produced. For this reason it appeared to
me, that at present, the most important
part of this process is the means it offers of
multiplying indefinitely Daguerreotypes, by
means of the electrotype. An ordinary
Daguerreotype, it is known, will, when
electrotyped, leave a faint impression; but
in so doing it is entirely destroyed; and
this impression cannot be perpetuated;
but one thus etched at the voltaic anode,
will admit of any number of copies being
taken from it. To give an idea of the perfect
accuracy of these, I may mention, that
in one I have taken, on which is a sign-board
measuring on the electrotype plate
0.1 by 0.06 of an inch, five lines of inscription
can, with the microscope, be distinctly
read. The great advantages of the voltaic
over the chemical process of etching, appear
to me to be the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. By the former, an indefinite variety
of menstrua may be used; thus, solutions
of acids, alkalies, salts, more especially the
haloid class, sulphurets, cyanurets, in fact,
any element which may be evolved by electrolysis,
may be made to act upon the
plate.</p>

<p>2nd. The action is generalized; and local
voltaic currents are avoided.</p>

<p>3rd. The time of operation can be accurately
determined; and any required depth
of etching produced.</p>

<p>4th. The process can be stopped at any
period, and again renewed if desirable.</p>

<p>The time I have given is calculated for
experiments made with one pair of the nitric
acid battery; it is, however, by no
means necessary that this be employed, as
probably any other form of voltaic combination
may be efficient. It would seem
more advisable to employ a diaphragm battery,
or one which produces a constant current,
as otherwise the time cannot be accurately
determined. It is very necessary
that the silver of plates subjected to this
process be homogeneous. Stri&aelig;, imperceptible
in the original Daguerreotype, are instantly
brought out by the action of the nascent
anion; probably silver, formed by
voltaic precipitation, would be found the
most advantageous. I transmit with this
paper some specimens of the prints of the
etched plates, and of electrotypes taken
from them; and in conclusion would call
attention to the remarkable instance which
these offer, of the effects of the imponderable
upon the ponderable: thus, instead of
a plate being inscribed, as "drawn by
Landseer, and engraved by Cousins," it
would be "drawn by Light, and engraved
by Electricity!"</p>

been suggested from the fact that one of our
fraternity lost his hand by an accidental

palm of his hand, in such a manner as to
render amputation necessary. <i>White of

<h2><a id="PAINTING"></a>PAINTING&mdash;ITS ORIGIN AND HISTORY.</h2>

<p class="caption3nb">BY WILLIAM WALCUTT.</p>

<p>There is no doubt of painting being coeval
with written language, or it may be
said, that the simple representation of
figures, on tablets prepared for the purpose,
were the first means used by men to record
particular events, actions, and so forth, and
may therefore be dated back farther than
any written language; and, indeed, may
be considered the foundation from which it
sprung, it being not improbable, because it
is so natural, that the very first dwellers on
the earth may have recorded their young
history by means of representations of corporeal
objects.</p>

<p>Many will say that such rude delineations
were not painting, but everything has its
beginning. From these simple lines has
the perfection of painting sprung, what
Artist does not remember the feeble attempts
he made at representations when
but a child; does he not remember them
with pleasure, and did he not then, and
does he not now, consider them, feeble as
they were, paintings? The first efforts
at delineation were painting, without regard
to color, or without regard to their
truth in delineation. The origin of what
may now be called painting, as an art instructive
or decorative, is altogether involved
in obscurity&mdash;authorities differing widely
on the subject. Pliny dates its invention
to a period antecedent to the siege of Troy,
and other writers after. The Egyptians
boasted of possessing the art six thousand
years before the Greeks, but this has always
been doubted. They certainly practised
painting at a very early period, and Cambyses
destroyed all the monuments of art
he found in Egypt, as much as was in his
power, which is some argument in favor of
the statement; and hence all such monuments
as display specimens of the art, must
be posterior to his invasion. The remains
of Egyptian painting, now extant, are but
poor representations of the human, and
other figures, showing a meagre advance in
the art, being weakly and falsely drawn
with no natural grouping or attempts at
sentiment. The Ph&oelig;nicians were an early
cultivated people, and have the credit of
first inventing letters, and therefore may,
by the best authority, lay claim to the invention
of painting. King Solomon, one
thousand years before Christ, held their ingenuity
in such high regard, that he employed
them as the master workmen in
building his temple, and the scriptures describe
the magnificence of the columns and
their capitals, and the borders and cornishes
and the doors, besides the great brazen sea,
supported by twelve oxen. The coins also
of this people, that have come down to us,
show in design, and execution, a good condition
in the arts.</p>

<p>The scriptures abound in references to
the arts. When Jacob took away the
daughter of Laban, she stole and secreted
from search some of her father's household
gods. One of the great commandments, is
that the children of Israel shall "not make
unto themselves any graven image, or any
likeness of any thing that is in the heavens
above, or in the earth beneath, or in the
waters under the earth." As before mentioned,
the temple of Solomon appears to
have been richly and elaborately decorated
with works of art; and the <span class="smcap">IV</span> chapter
Ezekiel commences with these words:
"Thou also son of man, take thee a tile,
and lay it before thee, and portray upon it
the city, even Jerusalem." And in the
<span class="smcap">XXIII</span> chapter, 14 verse, it is written
thus: "For when she saw men portrayed
on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans
portrayed with vermilion, girded with
girdles about their loins, exceeding in dyed
attire upon their heads." Also in the <span class="smcap">VII</span>
chapter, 10 verse: "So I went in and saw
and beheld every form of creeping things,
and abominable beasts, and all the idols of
the house of Israel, portrayed upon the wall
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
round about." Also in Numbers <span class="smcap">XXXIII</span>
chapter and 52 verse: "Then he shall
drive out all the inhabitants of the land
from before you, and destroy all their pictures,
and destroy all their molten images."</p>

<p>The Persians, the Arabians, and the Parthians,
from their peculiar education, have
no claims whatever to the art of painting,
a rude representation of the human figure,
with them, was considered as vulgar as the
appearance of a naked person. Their
figures are almost invariably clothed in
clumsy draperies, profusely painted. They
were worshippers of fire, and used no representations
of their deity; and it is a curious
fact, that, in their successful invasion
of Egypt, they carried away with them no
taste for the arts, or imbibed any of the religious
principles of that polytheistic country.</p>

<p>The art of painting appears to have remained
in the same state in China, without
any particular change from time immemorial.
They have never attempted anything
beyond mere imitation, and that entirely
devoid of taste or truth. The human figure,
with them, is a ludicrous deformity,
and their perspective is gained, by piling
one object above another, until the picture
as all ground and no sky. Invention and
Imagination were never known among
them; and, although the elaborateness of
many of their works is astonishing, yet
with such a people, it would be useless to
look for the origin and progress of art.</p>

<p>The arts of the Etruscans are famous for
the vases they produced. Etruria, in its
ancient state, was one of the most powerful
and civilized countries in Italy. Though
the history of this nation is involved in obscurity,
as the Romans tried every means
in their power to destroy all its claims to
refinement, yet there are sufficient proofs
remaining of the height and perfection to
which they carried the fine arts. Near the
town of Civita Vecchia stood the ancient
Etruscan city of Tarquinia, near which
are found numbers of sepulchral grottoes,
many of which are decorated with paintings
and figures much in the style of those
on the Etruscan vases. Some of the pictures
represent combats, and others dances
of females, executed with considerable
spirit. The pottery before mentioned, however,
affords the greatest number of their
specimens of the art of design; the forms
displayed in the contour of the vases, no
less than the paintings with which they
are decorated, show the wonderful attainment
in elegance of design, purity of form,
and ingenuity of delineation. The power
over line, and the facility of execution they
reached, may be easily conceived from the
absorbent nature of the material upon
which they wrought. No retouching was
possible; but the whole must have been
completely arranged in the mind of the artist
before it could be struck off. Pliny
states, that in his day, the town of Ardea,
an ancient city of Etruria, contained some
paintings which he ascribes to a period anterior
to the founding of Rome, and mentions
with surprise their then perfect state
of preservation. At Lacurium also, he describes
some pictures of Atalanta and
Helen, which were simply painted on the
wall, and exhibited great merit in execution.
These Caligulo, after a fruitless attempt,
failed in removing. Cere, another
Etruscan city, boasted some paintings of
an early date. All these specimens, although
of remote date, have no positive
clue by which to ascertain anything positive
as to the origin of the art of painting.
And we are obliged to turn to Greece for
the foundation from whence sprung works
still the admiration of the world.</p>

<p>Religion was the motive of Greek art;
it was, therefore, natural that they should
endeavor to invest their own authors, for
they considered themselves of divine origin,
with the most perfect forms; and as man
possessed that exclusively, they completely
and thoroughly studied the elements of his
constitution. The climate was favorable
to the development of that form, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
establishment of exercises by their civil
and political institutions, created models in
nature, which elevated Greek art to the
highest excellence.</p>

<p>The next step of the art was the monogram,
which is the outline of figures without
light or shade, with the addition, however,
of parts within the outline. From this the
monochrom, or painting with a single
color, and a white ground, then covered
with punic wax, first amalgamated with a
resinous pigment generally of a red, sometimes
of a dark brown or black color, was
the next advance. Through this inky
ground, the outlines were traced with a
firm though plyant style, called a cestrum:
the line could be altered by the finger or a
sponge, and easily replaced by a new one.
When the whole was settled, it was suffered
to dry, and covered with a brown encaustic
varnish; the lights were worked
over again, and rendered more brilliant
with a more delicate point, according to
the gradual advance from mere outline to
some indication; and at last to masses of
light and shade&mdash;thence to the superinduction
of different colors, or the invention of
polychrom, which, by the addition of the
pencil to the style, raised the stained drawing
to a legitimate picture, and at length
produced that vaunted harmony&mdash;"the
magic scale of Grecian color."</p>

<p>The period at which the pencil supplanted
the cestrum cannot be ascertained. Apollodorus
in the 93d Olympiad, and Zeuxis,
in the 94th, are said to have used it with
freedom and power. Parrhasins painted
the battle of the Lapitht&aelig; and centaurs on
the shield of Minerva for Phidias, to enable
Mys to chase it. It was nearly a century
after this that Appelles and Protogenes
had a competition in drawing lines with the
pencil, in which "delicacy and evanescent
subtlety being the characteristic, some
notion of their mechanical skill may be
formed."</p>

<p>Encaustic painting was accomplished by
using the colors in wax, as they are used
now in oil, drying them by a fire, and polishing
the surface by dry friction.</p>

<p>Polygnotus is the first great name that
appears in history, that any satisfactory
data of the arts may be commenced from.
He lived about 400 years B. C. So great
was his success in the P&oelig;cile at Athens, and
the Desche, or public hall at Delphi, that
in a great council of the Amphyctons, it
was solemnly decreed "that his expenses,
whenever he travelled in Greece, should be
borne at the public charge." His pictures
were admired by Pliny, at the distance of
six hundred years.</p>

<p>The first painting on record is the battle
of Magnete, by Balarchus, and purchased
by Candaules, King of Lydia, for its weight
in gold, or, as some say, a quantity of gold
coins equal to its surface.</p>

<p>After Aglaophon, Phidias, Panenus, Colotes,
and Evenor, the father of Parrhasins,
came Apollodorus, the Athenian. This
painter applied the essential principles of
Polygnotus to the delineation of the species,
by investigating the leading forms that discriminate
the different classes of human
qualities and passions. The acuteness of
his taste led him to discover, that, as all
men were connected by one general form,
so were they separated by some peculiar
individuality. Pliny and Plutarch considered
Apollodorus as the first colorist of his
age, and it is very probable, by their descriptions,
that he was the inventor of local
color and tone. Zeuxis succeeded to Apollodorus,
and by uniting in one figure the
most perfect parts of many models, produced
an ideal form, which, in his opinion,
constituted the supreme degree of human
beauty. Lucian describes a picture he exhibited
at the Olympic Games as remarkable
for its invention. It represented a female
centaur, suckling her young. It was carried
off from Athens by Sylla, but lost on
the voyage to Italy.</p>

<p>Parrhasins, a native of Ephesus, but a
citizen of Athens, was the son of a disciple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of Evenor, and contemporary of Zeuxis.
By his subtle examination of outline, "he
established that standard of divine and
heroic form, which raised him to the authority
of a legislator, from whose decisions
there was no appeal." He was a
thorough master of allegory, from the fact
of his embodying by signs, universally understood,
the Athenian people. In a competition
with Timanthes, he had the mortification
of being declared, by a majority
of votes, inferior to him. The subject for
competition, was the contest of Ajax and
Ulysses for the arms of Achilles.</p>

<p>The sacrifice of Iphigenia in Aulis, by
Timanthes, acquired the greatest celebrity
of all the ancient pictures. Quintilian says
that it was painted in contest with Colotes
of Teos&mdash;an artist from the school of Phidias,
and crowned with victory at its rival
exhibition. This picture, which has been
the subject of unlimited praise by the ancient
critics, has been in modern times objected
to, from the circumstance of Timanthes
hiding the face of Agamemnon, the
father of the victim, to be immolated in his
mantle, unable, as it was supposed by his
art, to express the entire agony of his grief.
Sir Joshua Reynolds observes thus: "If
difficulties overcome make a great part of
the merit of art, difficulties evaded can deserve
but little commendation." The French
critic Falconet, has also condemned the artifice.
But Fuseli answers these objections
very reasonably by saying,&mdash;"The subject
of Timanthes was the immolation of Sphigenia.
Sphigenia was the principal figure,
and her form, her resignation, or her anguish,
was the painter's principal task; the
figure of Agamemnon, however important,
is merely accessary, and no more necessary
to make the subject completely tragic, than
that of Dytemnestra, the mother&mdash;no more
than that of Priam, to impress us with
sympathy at the death of Polyxenia."
Again, "they ascribe to impotence what
was the forbearance of judgment." Timanthes
felt like a father; he did not hide the
face of Agamemnon, because it was beyond
the power of his art&mdash;not because it was
beyond the possibility, but because it was
beyond the dignity of expression&mdash;because
the inspiring feature of paternal affection
at that moment, and the action which of
necessity must have accompanied it, would
either have destroyed the grandeur of the
character, and the solemnity of the scene,
or subject the painter, with the majority of
his judges, to the imputation of insensibility.
The same expedient was resorted
to by M. Angelo, in the figure of Abijam,
and by Raphael in the expulsion from paradise.</p>

<p>These were the artists who formed the
second school of art, and established its
end and limits. On it was founded the
third period of style, in which refinement
induced a grace and beauty not to be surpassed.
The masters of this period were&mdash;Appelles,
Protogenes, Aristides, Euphranor,
Pausius, and the pupils of Pamphilius, and
his master Eupompus. The last named
artist was of Sicyon; and his authority was
so great, that out of the Asiatic and Grecian
chords of painting he formed a third, by
dividing the last into the attic and Sicyonian.
Pliny says that, when consulted by
Zysippus on a standard of imitation in art,
he pointed to the crowd passing by&mdash;observing
that nature, not an artist, should be
the object of imitation. Pamphilius, a Macedonian,
the master of Appelles, adopted
the doctrines of Eupompus. To the art of
painting, he joined the study of mathematics,
and held, that, without the aid of geometry,
no artist could arrive at any perfection.
In Appelles, we are told by Pliny,
unrivalled excellence was found. Grace
was his powerful and peculiar faculty, in
which he surpassed all his predecessors.
His Venus Anadyomene, which was long
after purchased by Augustus for one hundred
talents, or &pound;20,000 sterling, was esteemed
the most faultless creation of the
Grecian pencil, the most perfect example
of that simple yet unapproachable grace of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
expression, of symmetry of form, and exquisite
finish, in which may be summed up
the distinctive beauties of his genius. Hotogenes
was next to him in merit. The
most celebrated of his works was his figure
of Jalysus, with his dog, which occupied
him seven years. Aristides, of Theles,
and cotemporary of Appelles, was the first,
who, by the rules of art, obtained a perfect
knowledge of expressing the passions and
affections of the mind. In one figure, he
expressed the anguish of maternal affection,
and the pangs of death. Euphranor,
the Isthmian, and pupil of Aristides, is said
to have carried this refinement of expression
still further. Skilled in Sculpture, as
well as in Painting, his conceptions were
noble and elevated; his style masculine and
bold; and he was the first who distinguished
himself, by imparting majesty to
his heroes.</p>

<p>Asclepiodorus, the Athenian sculptor, as
well as painter, was as the latter, celebrated
for the beauties of a correct style, and the
truth of his proportions. Appelles allowed
himself to be, in these respects, as much
his inferior to this artist as he was to Amphion
on the good ordering and disposition
of his figures. About this period appeared
Nichomachus, Nichophanes, Pyreicas and
others. Nichias, an Athenian, 322 B. C.,
was in great repute for the great variety
and noble choice of his subjects, for the
mode of distributing his lights and shadows,
and for great skill in the representation of
animals. In Rome, 300 B. C., Fabius, a
noble Roman, painted the Temple of
Health, and gloried so much in the art, that
he assumed the name of Pictor. Without
a further enumeration of masters, for a long
period after the reigns of Vespasian and
his son Titus, painting, as well as sculpture,
continued to flourish in Italy. Even
under their successors Domitian, Nerva and
Trojan, they met with as much encouragement
as they did in the most palmy days of
Greece, although painting was used in
mere ornamental decorations&mdash;that is, to a
great extent, and artists had sunk, for the
most part, to the standard of mere mechanics.
Under Adrian, Antonine, Alexander
Severns, Constantine, and Valentinian,
the art of painting continued to be an
object of interest; but at length, in the
reign of Phocus, with the fall of the Empire,
with the rest of the noble arts and
sciences, it was involved in the common
heap of ruins.</p>

<h2><a id="BROMINE"></a>BROMINE.</h2>

<p>We give the folk wing interesting combination
and experiments with bromine, as
found in Hill's Treatise:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Discovered in 1826, by M. Balard, a
young chemist of Montpellier, France.
He named it <i>Muride</i>, because obtained
from the sea; but it acquired its present
name from a Greek word, signifying <i>rank</i>,
or <i>dead odor</i>." It exists in nature in very
small quantities. It is found in the waters
of every sea which has been tested for it: it
is also found in many mineral and salt
springs. We have not been able to determine
to whom belongs the honor of discovering
its use as an accelerator in Daguerreotype.
Having corresponded with
Prof. Morse, (who was certainly one of the
first who took portraits by the Daguerreian
process,) Dr. Draper, and others, to whom
this honor has been awarded, they refuse to
claim it. Prof. Silliman, who is supposed
to know everything relating to science,
writes to me that he does not know this. I
am quite inclined to place the wreath on the
brow of the inventor of the Magnetic Telegraph.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Process.</span>&mdash;When common salt is prepared
from sea-water by evaporation and crystallization,
a liquid remains which goes under
the name of <i>bittern</i>. This liquid on
passing chlorine through it, is tinged with
a deep yellow color. The liquid is now
distilled, and the vapor passed over a substance,
(muriate of lime), which has a
powerful attraction for water. A small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
quantity of bromine is thus obtained.&mdash;Another
method is to agitate the chlorinated
bittern with a portion of sulphuric ether.
The ether dissolves the bromine, from
which it receives a beautiful red tint, and
on standing, rises to the surface. Agitate
this solution with caustic potash, and the
bromide of potassium and bromate of potassa
will be formed. Evaporate the liquor
and the bromide of potassium will be left
from which bromine may be distilled.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Properties.</span>&mdash;At common temperatures,
it rapidly volatilizes, giving red vapors of a
most disagreeable smell. Its color, when
held between the eye and the light is a
deep hyacinth red. Like oxygen, chlorine,
and iodine, it is a non-conductor of electricity,
and a negative electric. It boils at
116&middot;5&deg;, and congeals at 40 Fahr. into a
brittle solid. It is a powerful poison;
even its vapor would no doubt prove fatal,
if inhaled in large quantities. A single
drop placed in the beak of a bird destroys
it instantly. Operators cannot be too cautious
in using it. A very small drop spattered
in the eye would destroy the sight.
Bromine is very corrosive. A lighted taper
burns for a few moments in its vapor, with
a flame green at its base, and red at the top,
and is then extinguished. It is soluble in
water, alcohol, and ether; the latter is the
best solvent. With water at 32&deg; Fahr.,
if forms a <i>hydrate</i>, in crystals of a fine red
color. It gives to a solution of starch an
orange color. Chlorine will displace it
from all its combinations with hydrogen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chloride of Bromine.</span>&mdash;Formed by
transmitting a current of chlorine through
bromine, and condensing the disengaged vapors
by a freezing mixture. The factitious
article is more simply formed, and is equally
good as an accelerator, but not as quick.
See page 25, Part I. M. Bissou, a Frenchman,
found that the real chloride of bromine
is so sensitive, that Daguerreotype
proofs are taken by it in half a second. He
succeeded in taking persons and animals in
the act of walking.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromic Acid</span> may be obtained by pouring
sulphuric acid upon a dilute solution of
bromide of baryta, and evaporating. No
interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromide of Baryta.</span>&mdash;Boil of protobromide
of iron with moist carbonate of baryta;
carefully evaporate and it will crystallize
in white rhombic prisms, which have a
bitter taste, are slightly deliquescent, and
soluble in water and alcohol.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromide of Carbon.</span>&mdash;Formed by mixing
one part of periodide of carbon with
two of bromine. Two compounds are
formed, the <i>bromide of carbon</i>, and the
<i>sub-bromide of iodine</i>; the latter is removed
by a solution of caustic potassa. It is
liquid at common temperatures, but crystallizes
at 32&deg; Fahr.; sweet to the taste,
and of a penetrating ethereal odor; distinguished
from the protiodide by the vapor
which it emits on being heated. The <i>periodide
of carbon</i> is made by mixing an alcoholic
solution of pure potash and of iodine.
It forms crystals of a pearly lustre, sweet to
the taste, and of a saffron odor. The <i>protiodide</i>
is formed by distilling a mixture of
the preceding compound with corrosive sublimate.
Sweet in taste, and of a penetrating
ethereal odor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromide of Magnesium.</span>&mdash;Dissolve magnesia
in hydrobromic acid. It will crystallize
in small acicular crystals, of a sharp
taste, very deliquescent and soluble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromide of Sulphur.</span>&mdash;Pour bromine on
sublimed sulphur. There is formed an oily
liquid of a reddish tint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromide of Phosphorus</span>, is formed by
bringing phosphorus and bromine into contact
in a jar filled with carbonic acid gas.
Vaporizes by heat, and is decomposed by
water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromide of Silicon</span>, is prepared by
burning silicon in the vapor of bromine.
A very dense, colorless liquid, emitting
dense fumes. We have used this article as
an accelerator, and it produces a beautiful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
but singular picture. It works quick, but
possesses no particular advantage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bromide of Zinc.</span>&mdash;Prepared by digesting
a solution of bromine with zinc filings.
The iodide is formed in a similar manner.
No interest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hydrobromic Acid.</span>&mdash;Mix the vapor of
bromine with about an equal bulk of hydrogen
gas, and introduce a coil of red-hot
platinum wire. Red-hot iron answers
equally well. The combination takes
place slowly without explosion. Or, it may
be formed by placing a small piece of phosphorus
in a glass tube filled with water,
and dropping it upon a little bromine.
The hydrobromic acid passes over in the
form of a gas, and may be passed through
water, which will absorb it. <i>Hydriodic
Acid</i> is formed in the same way, using
iodine in place of the bromine. Hydrobromic
acid is decomposed instantly by chlorine
and nitric acid.</p>

<p>The French and German bromine is generally
considered the best; but the American
manufacture is by no means to be rejected,
as it is frequently very excellent.
Bromine is sometimes adulterated with
naphtha.</p>

<h2><a id="NITRATE"></a>NITRATE OF SILVER.</h2>

<p class="caption3nb">DECOMPOSED BY THE CURRENT OF A GALVANIC
BATTERY.</p>

<p>Mr. Matteucci has observed that the
black deposit obtained on the cathode, in
the electrolysis of this salt, instantaneously
becomes white when the current ceases;
that it does not occur except when the solution
is weak, because from strong solutions,
crystalline silver is at once deposited;
that if a portion of the deposit, after it has
became white, be suspended between the
electrodes while the current passes, those
portions towards the anode again become
<i>black</i>, if the experiment is made in a solution
of the nitrate, but not if in mere acid
water; it will, however, occur if a mere
drop of nitrate is added to the solution, if
a plate of a glass is interposed between the
electrodes, the phenomenon does not occur;
this is attributed to the great reduction of
intensity. It is suggested "that the black
deposit is formed, of oxide of silver, which
is preserved by the passage of the current,
and which, when the current ceases, passes
immediately to the metallic condition."</p>

<p class="caption3nb">OXIDE OF SILVER.</p>

<p>Place pieces of silver in a glass vessel,,
and pour on them about equal parts of
water and strong nitric acid; the metal
will soon dissolve, giving off fumes of nitric
oxide. Should the solution have a
green hue, which is invariably the case,
unless the metal has been obtained fine
from the refiners, it indicates the presence
of copper, in which case immerse some
pieces of copper in the solution, and the nitric
acid, by elective affinity, will combine
with the copper; and a precipitate of pure
silver, in the form of grayish powder, will
take place. Throw away the liquid and
wash the silver precipitate several times
in sulphuric acid and water, and afterwards
in water alone. Then re-dissolve it
as before, in nitric acid and water; and a
<i>solution of pure nitrate of silver</i> will be obtained.
Place this in an evaporating dish,
or a saucer, and apply the heat of a spirit-lamp,
or place the saucer by the fire-side,
till some portion of the liquid is driven off
in vapor. Allow the residue to cool, and it
will shoot out into long colorless transparent
crystals, which are <i>nitrate of silver</i>.
They must be handled with care, as they
possess the property of staining animal and
vegetable substances with an almost indelible
black;&mdash;fused nitrate of silver being
the lunar caustic of surgery, and the main
ingredient of marking-ink. Next prepare
some <i>lime-water</i>, by stirring lime into water
and filtering the solution. As lime is very
sparingly soluble in water, requiring, at
60&deg; Fahrenheit, 750 times its weight, it is
necessary to make an abundant supply.
Place the lime-water in a glass or other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
vessel, and drop in it a few crystals of nitrate
of silver; the colorless solution will
instantly assume an unsightly brown hue;
and, after remaining quiescent for a time,
the <i>oxide of silver</i> will subside in the form
of a dark brown precipitate. The liquid is
then poured off, and the precipitate is washed
with water. Before throwing away the
liquid, fresh lime-water should be added to
it; and if the dark hue recurs, the precipitate
must be allowed to subside again; if
no change takes place, it may be inferred
that the silver is all extracted. The oxide
of silver should not be dried, but be kept
in bottles with water.</p>

<h2><a id="POTASSIUM"></a>POTASSIUM.</h2>

<p class="caption3nb">CYANIDE OR SIMPLE CYANURET OF POTASSIUM.</p>

<p>Before entering into the preparation of
this ingredient, I may mention that the
<i>prussiate of potash</i> of commerce has, by
many young experimentalists, been mistaken
for the above article, because it is
often sold, by those unacquainted with
chemical technicalities, under the name of
<i>cyanuret of potassium</i>. It is, in chemical
parlance, termed <i>ferro-cyanuret</i>, from its
containing a certain portion of iron; and
differs in its properties, very materially,
from the <i>simple</i> salt. It is of a bright yellow
color, and is converted into the colorless,
simple cyanuret in the following
manner:</p>

<p>Take 4 ounces of the yellow prussiate,
break it in small pieces, and well dry it on
a plate of iron; then reduce it in a mortar
to exceedingly fine powder. Dry and pound
in like manner one and a-half oz. of carbonate
of potash. Incorporate the two ingredients
thoroughly. Place a Hessian
crucible in the fire; and when it attains a
red heat, throw into it the prepared mixture,
and closely cover the crucible. Keep up the
heat, and the contents of the crucible will
soon fuse; and the fluid mass will become
red-hot. After this, immerse in it, from
time to time, a hot glass rod; the mass
which adheres, is in the early stages of the
process brown on cooling; as the heat is
continued, it appears yellowish, and finally,
colorless and transparent. The operation
is then complete: the crucible must be removed;
and after its contents have been
allowed to settle, the fused mass may be
poured off; the greater portion of which
consists of the <i>simple cyanuret of potassium</i>.
This salt is very deliquescent, and
must therefore be retained in close bottles:
it will readily be recognized by its powerful
odor,&mdash;that noticed in peach blossoms.
The mere mention of prussic acid entering
largely into its composition, will be sufficient
to induce my reader to exercise common
caution in handling it.</p>

<p>Having these ingredients prepared, take
one pint of pure rain or distilled water; add
to it two ounces of the cyanuret of potassium,
shake them together occasionally,
until the latter is entirely dissolved; and
allow the liquid to become clear. Then
add a quarter of an ounce of oxide of silver,
which will very speedily dissolve; the
dissolution may be hastened by heat, and
after a short time, a clear transparent solution
will be obtained.&mdash;<i>Walker.</i></p>


<h2><a id="STEREO-CHROMIC"></a>STEREO-CHROMIC PAINTING.</h2>

<p>A new mode of fresco painting, called
<i>Stereo-chromie</i>, which has for a long time
excited attention among the artists of Germany,
has it appears been perfected by a
pupil of Kaulbach, in his own studio in
Munich. The design is Kaulbach's, and
the work was executed under his superintendence.
It represents the figure and character
of a Prophet, and will be sent to the
London Exhibition. 'The figure, grand
and majestic as it really is, cannot be expected
to convey to the English public anything
but a faint idea of the genius and skill
of Kaulbach,' but as a specimen of this new
and wonderful mode of painting, it will be
regarded, by artists, with the greatest
curiosity.</p>

<p><i>Stereo-chromie</i> was discovered by <i>Obergrath
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
von Fuchs</i>, a distinguished chemist;
and is considered by German artists as one
of the greatest discoveries of the age.
They claim for it great advantage over ordinary
fresco and encaustic painting, in its
superior durability and the power which it
affords the artist of retouching and glazing
his picture. The colors are mixed with
water, the whole being permanently fixed
by occasional sprinklings of water, in which
a certain proportion of fluoric-acid (<i>Flassspath saurs</i>) is mixed.</p>

<p><i>Stereo-chromie</i> is in fact a preserver of
the wall on which it is painted, By a certain
chemical action of the solution sprinkled
over the picture, while in progress, the
whole ground on which it is placed, and the
picture itself becomes one hard flinty mass,
the very colors of which are converted into
the hardest stone.</p>

<p>This singular species of painting resists,
it is said, every influence of climate; and
may be securely used as an external coating
for buildings in any part of the globe.
Neither is the artist confined to any particular
time in executing it, leaving off when
he pleases and for any length of time. In
these points it is a most important recommendation,
which cannot by any means apply
to fresco work, nor, except within certain
limits, to oil painting. The highest
advantage of all, however, is that the same
part may be painted over as often as the
artist please, which is impossible in fresco;
and consequently the most perfect harmony
may, by this new mode be preserved
throughout the largest possible painting.
In fresco the artist is the slave of his materials;
here, he is the arbitrary master
and to the fullest extent.&mdash;<i>Banner of the

<h2><a id="WATER"></a>WATER.</h2>

<p>Water intended to aid in conducting
chemical experiments, should, so far as possible,
be free from all foreign substances.
As the Daguerreotype process is one of the
most difficult in the range of chemical
science, the Daguerreian should have at
hand the best that circumstances will admit.
We have learned, from experience,
the disadvantages attendant on those who
travel in the country, from village to village
in the practice of the Daguerreotype art.</p>

<p>When <i>Distilled Water</i> can be obtained,
it should be used. It must have no smell,
taste, or color; it must evaporate without
leaving a residue; it must give no precipitates
with solutions of nitrate of silver,
chloride of barium, superoxalate of potash,
caustic alkalies, carbonated alkalies, sulphurated
hydrogen, or hydrosulphate of
ammonia.</p>

<p><i>Rain Water</i> generally contains carbonic
acid, carbonate of lime, and chloride of calcium.</p>

<p><i>Spring Water</i> contains the same impurities
as rain water, superadded to chloride of
sodium, sulphate of lime, carbonate of
iron, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>River Water.</i>&mdash;More free from salts than
spring water, but often contains a large
quantity of decomposing vegetable and animal
matter. This is particularly the case
with water taken from the Hudson, from
Troy to its mouth; also, the Mississippi,
and, in fact, almost all large streams which
are navigated.</p>

<p><i>Lake Water.</i>&mdash;All descriptions of stagnant
water abound in half-putrified organic remains,
as all well know, that the smaller
the bulk of liquid, as in the case of the
swamp or marsh, the more impure and
the more unwholesome it is.</p>

<p><i>To purify Water.</i>&mdash;Much has been said
about purifying water for Daguerreotype
use. We look upon this, so far as chemical
agents are employed, in most instances a
loss of both time and money; let every one
<i>filter</i> the water for use <i>often</i> and freely and
we will guarantee that <i>success</i> will be his
reward. We will class water in the following
order:&mdash;</p>

<p>1, Distilled water; 2, rain water; 3,
brook water; 4, well water; 5, spring
water; 6, river water: yet the water from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
some of our Western lakes would, we think
be fully equal to rain water. We have used
the water from Seneca lake, and have
found it possessing less animal and vegetable
matter, than found in the water from any
well which we have been compelled to use.</p>

<p><a id="Isinglass"></a><span class="smcap">Isinglass</span>, as it is generally called fish glue,
is prepared from the air-bladders of the
sturgeon. It is found in commerce under various
forms, such as large strings, small
strings, and leaves. It is always white,
semi-transparent, dry, fibrous, horny, of a
faint odor and insipid taste. When a very
thin leaf is moved between the eye and the
light of the sun, a species of chatoyance is
perceived. If macerated in cold water,
Isinglass swells and softens; if boiled in
water, it dissolves almost without any residue
and forms a solution, which, on becoming
cool produces a semi-transparent
jelly. There are several counterfeits, but
all are easily detected.</p>

<h2><a id="PAPIER-MACHE"></a>PAPIER-MACHE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Papier-Mache.</span>&mdash;Pulped paper moulded
into forms. It possesses great strength and
is a valuable article in the manufacturing
of cases for Daguerreotypes. It may be
rendered partially water-proof by the addition
of sulphate of iron, quicklime, and
glue, or white of eggs, to the pulp; and incumbustible
by the addition of borax and
phosphate of soda. The papier-mache
Daguerreotype cases, tea-trays, waiters,
snuff-boxes, &amp;c., are prepared by pasting or
glueing sheets of paper together, and submitting
them to powerful pressure, by
which the composition acquires the hardness
of a board when dry. Such articles are
often inlaid with mother of pearl, and japanned, and are
then perfectly water-proof.</p>

<h2><a id="CHLORIDE"></a>CHLORIDE OF CALCIUM.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Chloride of Calcium.</span>&mdash;This is so easily
manufactured that any Daguerreotypist
can make it with but little difficulty.
Saturate dilated muriatic acid, say three
pints of water to one of acid; this should
be filtered through a sponge and then allowed
to stand until all the aquus solution has
evaporated and the calcium crystallized.
This may be improved by it being placed
in a crucible; and fused with a quick fire,
then poured out on a flat stone. When
cold, it should be broken and put in close
bottles. This is much used by Daguerreotypists
as it possesses a strong affinity for
water; consequently, it is a valuable auxiliary
in keeping the iodine dry. It is also
much used for drying gases and absorbing
water from ethereal and oily liquids, in organic
analyses.</p>

<h2><a id="MURIATE"></a>MURIATE OF AMMONIA.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Muriate of Ammonia</span>&mdash;<i>sal-ammoniac.</i>&mdash;This
is used by <i>few</i> to bleach Daguerreotype
impressions, and relieve them of the "<i>blues</i>;"
should, however, the plates be <i>well</i> cleaned
and the mercury at a proper temperature,
there will be no need of this preparation:
yet, as a number have requested, we give
the following combination, knowing that all
Daguerreotypists are troubled more or less
with solarized impressions, they may be
more particularly with the <i>blues</i>. Make a
saturated solution of muriate of ammonia,
in pure water, and filter through paper.
This reduced with an equal quantity of
water before used; when the linen or any
portion of the impression is badly solarized,
after removing the coating with the hyposulphite
solution, thoroughly rinse the plate
with water, then pour the bleaching solution
over the surface of the impression in
the same manner as in gilding.</p>

<p>If the solarization be very deep, apply
the lamp beneath and slightly warm the
plate, pour suddenly off, and without rinsing,
quickly apply the gilding and gild in
the usual way. The whole operation must
be quickly performed, or the chlorine soon
attracts the shade of the picture. There
may be instances when this solution may
prove of advantage, as, for instance, when
black velvet and milk white are wanted in
the same impression. We have seen it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
operate with pleasing success; but repeat
that <i>few</i> only use it, yet as in a single instance
it might be of value, we have given
it. As much of the muriate of ammonia, in
common, is adulterated, we will give a few
tests which all can try.</p>

<p>When pure, this salt is totally volatilizable
by heat; if a small portion on being
heated on a piece of platinum foil over a spirit
lamp leaves any fixed residue, it is adulterated.
It should dissolve entirely in water;
if it leaves an <i>insoluble residue</i> it is adulterated.
The impurities generally found in
sal-ammoniac, are sulphate of ammonia,
sulphate of soda, chloride of sodium, and
chloride of potassium; neither of these are
considered injurious in the <i>bleaching solution</i>.
Occasionally it contains lead, iron, and copper.
The presence of sulphuric acid may
be detected by means of a diluted solution
of <i>chloride</i> of barium, added to a weak solution
of muriate of ammonia, in water, this
will produce a white precipitate, which is
the more copious and dense, the less the liquor
is diluted. If it contains lead add
to a small portion of it, contained in a test
tube, a little diluted <i>sulphuric acid</i>, or a
few drops of a solution of <i>sulphate of soda</i>
(glauber's salt), if the liquid contains lead
there will be prevalent a white powder, or
precipitate, this powder scarcely dissolves
at all in diluted acids, but it dissolves in a
solution of caustic of potash: <i>iron</i>, mix a
solution of the yellow prussiate of potash
with a solution of red prussiate, a few drops
of this added to a weak solution of muriate
of ammonia will produce a blue precipitate;
<i>copper</i>, pour about half an ounce of the liquid
in a test tube, and add to it a few drops
of liquid ammonia, if copper is present, the
liquid will assume a blue color. Sal-ammonia
is known by giving out the odor of
ammonia when mixed with caustic of potash:
when sal-ammonia possesses a <i>brownish</i>
color, it indicates the presence of charcoal,
or empyreumatic oil; such sal-ammoniac
is good for some purposes, but wholly
unfit for <i>chemical purposes</i>.</p>

<p>When sal-ammoniac leaves a non-volatile
residue, it may contain <i>sulphate of soda</i>.
This is the principal cause of failures
with the bleaching solution, as the sulphate
of soda has a tendency to blacken
rather than bleach Daguerreian impressions.
The sulphate of soda as well as the chloride
of sodium, is often found in unpurified
sal-ammoniac to the amount of ten per cent.</p>

<p>When sal-ammoniac contains much sulphate
of ammonia, it fuses and sputters before
it sublimes; whereas it otherwise sublimes
without fusing. When sal-ammoniac,
sublimes without residue, but gives a
precipitate when its solution is tested
with a solution of chloride of barium, it
contains sulphate of ammonia; but when
it leaves a non-volatile residue, the precipitate
indicates sulphate of soda or sulphate
of magnesia.</p>

<h2><a id="BROMIDE_OF_SILVER"></a>BROMIDE OF SILVER.</h2>

<p class="caption3nb">NATIVE BROMIDE OF SILVER AND ANALYSES.</p>

<p>M. Berthier says, that in the district of
Plateros, seventeen leagues from Zacatecas
in Mexico, silver ore is found in two different
states; first, native silver; and secondly
and principally in a state of combination
in small olive-green or yellowish crystals,
supposed to be chloride, but which he found
to be bromide of silver. According to M.
Duport, from whom M. Berthier received
these specimens, this substance is not rare
in Mexico, but occurs frequently in fine
cubic and octahedral crystals.</p>

<p>The specimen examined by M. Berthier
was from San Onofe. It was compact, of
a slightly reddish gray color; fracture uneven;
splendent; penetrated with small
cavities, some of which were partially filled
with a substance of a dull pale yellow
color, and which the miners call oxide of
lead; other cavities contain very small imperfect
crystals; which are brilliant, and
of a pale olive green-color, and have the
appearance of chloride of silver. This
specimen was very rich, for it yielded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
0.0688 of silver, and contained 0.45 of carbonate
of lead, which, intimately mixed
with quartz and a little oxide of iron, formed
the principal portion of the mass.</p>

<p>M. Berthier has also found this mineral
among the silver ores of Huelgoeth, department
of Finist&egrave;re in France. Two
specimens were obtained by him: the first
of these is described as being porous or
scoriform, containing white quartz imbedded
in foliated hydrate of iron. On the
edges of the foliated iron ore the naked eye
could distinguish small cubic grains of a
pearl-white color, which had all the characters
of chloride of silver.</p>

<p>The second specimen had the appearance
of compact oxide of iron, containing here
and there milk-white quartz; it was
throughout impregnated with chloride of
silver, which occasionally appeared in the
form of very small brilliant crystals. To
analyze this mineral, 10 grammes were
first treated with ammonia, and heat
to dissolve the chloride of silver, and
afterwards by boiling hydrochloric acid
to dissolve the oxide of iron; this acid
also dissolved a certain portion of lead,
which probably was in the state of phosphate.
The quartzose residue weighed
32.6 grammes: it contained 0.17 gramme
of silver, which must have been in the metallic
state: the ammoniacal solution gave
by boiling and saturation with nitric acid,
1.84 gramme of chloride of silver, which,
supposing it to be pure, contained 1.40
gramme of silver, which, added to 0.17
gramme remaining in the quartz, gives a
total of 1.57 gramme; a result which differed
so very little from that obtained by
essaying, as to prove the absence of bromide
of silver, and that this was the case
was confirmed by additional experiments.</p>

<p>After this a third specimen was received
from Huelgoeth; it was very small, but as
rich as the foregoing, and in it there were
distinguishable, besides granular cubic
crystals of chloride of silver, other grains
of an olive-green color, which had exactly
the same appearance as the bromide had.
Plateros and the following experiments
proved the presence of the substance.</p>

<p>Five grammes of the pulverized mineral
were boiled in a solution of oxalic acid, until
the oxide of iron was perfectly dissolved:
the residue weighed about a gramme, and it
evidently contained a mixture of canary-yellow
and white grains. It was digested
in hot solution of ammonia until all the
yellow powder disappeared; it required a
large quantity of the alkali for this purpose,
which would not have been the case to dissolve
pure chloride. The solution was gradually
saturated with nitric acid, and it was
observed that the successive deposits formed
had an evident yellow tint, but gradually
diminishing in intensity, except the last,
which were white. The yellow deposits
were collected and examined in the following
manner:&mdash;A portion was treated with
chlorine and &aelig;ther; the &aelig;ther became of a
yellow color. Another portion was dissolved
in ammonia, hydrosulphate of ammonia
was added to the solution, and the black
precipitate formed was separated, and was
found to be pure sulphuret of silver. The
liquor was concentrated by exposure to the
air, and filtered to separate the sulphur
which was deposited; a little potash was
then added, and it was evaporated to dryness;
acetic acid was added to saturate the
excess of potash, and it was again dried.</p>

<p>To determine whether the saline residue
contained a bromide, a small portion of it
was treated in a tube with pure nitric acid,
and a yellow liquid was immediately obtained.
Another portion was mixed with
peroxide of manganese, and the mixture
was placed in a glass tube; a few drops of
concentrated sulphuric acid were added, and
when gently heated, red vapors were immediately
disengaged, and alter some lime
there were deposited on the sides of the
tube small drops of a red liquid. The existence
of bromine was therefore evident,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and it was proved that the bromide was
unmixed with iodide. Bromide of silver
appears to be rare at Huelgoeth; but it may
be readily distinguished from the chloride
by its greenish or canary-yellow color,
which is characteristic of it. It is remarkable
that it occurs with the chloride in the
same specimens, but without there being an
intimate mixture of the two substances.</p>

<h2><a id="HILLOTYPE"></a>HILLOTYPE.</h2>

<p>Since the announcement of the <span class="smcap">Hillotype</span>,
in the last number of the Daguerreian
Journal, quite an excitement has prevailed,
both in the Daguerreotype and
scientific world. The great question has
fairly been solved and "<i>natural colors</i>"
can be produced and rendered indelible
upon the metallic plate. America can
safely say she has presented to the world
one of the most invaluable discoveries that
has ever been imprinted upon the pages of
history.</p>

<p>Men profound in their scientific skill and
learning, have long and in vain sought for
the discovery or invention of some means
of securing to the future, the colors of the
present. All Europe has been alive to this
great desideratum, and many have presumed
it an impossibility, while some few
persisted, flattered by hope and encouraged
by the almost daily announcement of some
new discovery or invention, that heretofore
had been deemed only as having existence
in the dreamy imagination or a perspective
future. We hail the discovery of
the Hillotype as an epoch bright in the history
of science, as well as impregnated
with interest to aid in unfolding a volume
of investigation which has so long commanded
the attention of learned and philosophical minds,
as the "<i>colored rays of
light</i>."</p>

<p>The subject of reflected light and its
colors has long agitated the scientific mind.
Much has been said and written; elaborate
and laborious "Essays," "Researches" and
"Treatises" have penetrated our libraries and
proved valuable auxiliaries in pushing the
interest of those engaged in furthering
agricultural and chemical pursuits. This
branch of natural science is regarded as one
of the most important, and, at the present
moment, it is rendered doubly interesting
from the fact of Mr. Hill's discovery. We
may look forward for new developments,
which will prove no less surprising than that
of rendering permanent, on a metallic plate,
the variegated beauties of the solar spectrum.</p>

<p>We are, as it were, standing upon an eminence
from which we can survey the present,
retrospect the past, and almost sketch
the bright outline of a coming future.
Here lies a field for animated speculation,
in which nature's student can satiate his
appetite in the study of nature, in a province
hitherto unknown and unexplored;
he may here realize truths purely sublime,
painted in the glowing "colors of nature,"
and rendered prominent upon the tablet of
his memory.</p>

<p><a id="communication"></a>We present the following communication
from Mr. <span class="smcap">Hill</span>, which our readers will
peruse with pleasure:</p>

<p class="caption3">For the Daguerreian Journal.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">S. D. Humphrey, Esq.</span>;&mdash;Being detained
here a day on my way from your city, I relieve
myself a little from the tedium of
delay, by a few scribblings to your valuable
Journal. I will give a few particulars
respecting my pictures, &amp;c.</p>

<p>I have now fifty-five specimens. They
are all equally perfect. It is quite remarkable
that I have never yet made a partial
failure. Those impressions which have
had too much light, are nearly as strong,
sound, brilliant and beautiful as those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
correctly timed in the camera, being inferior
only in having the colors less deep.
Even the whites retain their strength.
The folds of the linen are always well defined.
Blue or solarized linen is unknown
in my process, and there is always a
strength and clearness in the whites, unattainable
by mercury. During the past
winter I have several times taken a view
in which there is a deep red house, while
the ground was covered with snow. For
experiment I exposed the plate so long as
to reduce the bright red of the house to a
<i>very light red</i>, while at the same time, the
white snow was developed with a beautiful
whiteness.</p>

<p>I have copied several very highly colored
French prints. The copies are far superior
to the originals, in that, while they
have <i>every</i> tint of color, they are exceedingly
brilliant. This is a characteristic in
which I never fail, even with the plates
merely cleaned with rotten stone&mdash;the brilliancy
depending on <i>other causes</i>. Well
polished plates, however, are preferable
for other reasons. It is <i>essential</i> that the
plates should be very pure, free from scum?
dampness, and organic matter of every
kind, and I am experimenting with different
substances, in hopes of finding something
that will more perfectly cleanse,
while it thoroughly polishes. I would be
very thankful to any person who might furnish
me with valuable hints on this point,
as I am convinced that here lies one great
cause of uncertainty.</p>

<p>My trouble with the <i>yellow</i>, which you
mentioned in the last number of the "Daguerreian
Journal," relates only to the homogeneous
rays, orange, buff, and all the
various shades of yellow come out true except
the <i>chrome yellow</i> which appears less
brilliant. This, however, is thought by distinguished
artists, no serious objection.</p>

<p>My late visit to your city was much
shorter than I could have wished. I called
on a number of Artists, and the cordial
manner in which they congratulated me
has added much to my kindly feelings towards
the fraternity, and strengthened my
resolution to give all worthy Daguerreotypists
and Artists, my process on terms which I
believe will be satisfactory. As far as this
is concerned, please say to such their interests
are safe in my hands. I met with but
one person anyway sceptical, and he is willing
to be more fully satisfied when he
"sees the pictures," which is very fair I am
sure. While it is very cheering to me, in
my truly arduous duties, to review the kind
congratulations of my brother Artists, the
most I am entitled to <i>claim</i> in an age when
almost every announcement is regarded as
humbug, is that the Daguerreian world will
give me a fair chance to perfect my discovery.
A few have seen my pictures, and
their expressed opinions agree with mine,
viz., that these pictures will astonish the
world. I saw in your city, in the hands of
Mr. Hite, Artist, some exquisite ivory miniatures.
It astonished me that the human
hand could paint "the form of the human
face divine," in such a mode; but I pleasantly
said to the Artist, what I now repeat
in all seriousness, that the pictures by my
process necessarily exceed in beauty the
finest productions of the painter, they being
drawn by light and painted by sun-beams.</p>

<p>I have heard several rumors while in the
city, in respect to my designs in the disposition
of my discovery. Allow me to say, for
the information of all concerned, that my
purpose is <i>unalterably</i> fixed to avoid <i>monopoly</i>,
and to take a course which will put
the process into general use.</p>

<p>To-morrow I start for my "mountain
home," and with my invigorated health and
spirit, I hope to resume my toils with a
prospect of bringing out my process at an
early day.</p>

of our fellow Daguerreotypists are cordially
welcoming us on by manfully and numerously
sending us their names for the Daguerreian
Journal for one year. When we
commenced our editorial labors we launched
our hark upon a sea never before thought
safe for regular navigation, but we find only
few snags in the way, and these are every day
lessened by our close application and the assistance
of kind friends. No man knows
his friends until they have an opportunity
to prove themselves.</p>

<p>With but few exceptions, all who subscribed
for the Journal for the first four
months have sent us two dollars worth of
the "root of all evil," for their subscription
for the balance of the year. We <i>bow</i>, and

that there is now in progress a machine
for cleaning and buffing plates. This machine
is an ingenious and valuable contrivance,
and it is said will polish a plate in

These wonderful specimens are on
plates eleven by thirteen inches, called
mammoth plates. Such pictures four or five
years ago would have filled the world with
admiration and surprise. The chemical
effect is clear and well worked, thus proving
well prepared plates can present large

worth while for every Daguerreian visiting

<p class="smcap p0">S. D. Humphrey, Esq.,</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:&mdash;I would fain give my testimony
in favor of your excellent Journal,
which is to the Daguerreian, as a guide to
the traveller, and pilot to the untaught
mariner. It needs but to meet his eye for
him to appreciate its value and secure its
aid, while following in his misty pathway.</p>

<p>I have long since learned that "experience
is the best teacher," but now since the
advent of the Journal, all who would be relieved
of difficulties incident to Daguerreian
life, may find the cause of <i>atmospheric
troubles&mdash;bad light&mdash;poor subjects&mdash;clouded
results</i>, &amp;c., reflected on its pages, and
thus, by close application, prevent the
many evils which so frequently attend
them, and thereby learn that "an ounce of
prevention is better than a pound of cure."</p>

<p>But there are those in the business who
do not seem to discover any difference between
the profile on the school-boy's slate,
and the best "aqua-tinta" engraving.
<i>They</i> never have any trouble in producing
<i>perfect</i> results at <i>every</i> sitting, and <i>that</i> for
the sum of one dollar or fifty cents. No
wonder the writer of the article on Daguerreotypes
in No. 5 of the Journal, says
"<i>Daguerreians</i> are not <i>artists</i>, nor Daguerreotypes
works of <i>Art</i>,
but <i>mere wonders of Nature</i>."</p>

<p>When Daguerreians adopt the motto&mdash;"Good
pictures and fair prices," they may
lay claim to the enviable name of Artist,
and not before. The Daguerreian art is
the most difficult art to practise with <i>perfect</i> success,
that has ever yet been discovered. A <i>perfect</i> Daguerreotype is the
result of a series of the most careful, delicate and complicated
experiments ever conceived of by the human mind.</p>

<p>I have been considerably amused in perusing
the Journal, in reading communications
from sources where I am acquainted.
They remind me of the old adage&mdash;"All is
not gold that glitters," for they appear to
far better advantage in print, than as <i>Artists</i>.
But enough of this. In conclusion,
permit me to speak of a method of copying
pictures, which, if new to any of your
readers, they will find it well worthy of
the trial. I find, by placing the picture to
be copied where the rays of the sun may
fall obliquely upon the plate, all reflection
is thrown off, and the image appears in the
camera, clear and distinct, even if the
original be very faint. It also shortens the
time of exposure to from one to five seconds.</p>

<h2><a id="AMMONIA"></a>AMMONIA.</h2>

<p>Ammonia should be a perfectly colorless
liquid; when concentrated its specific gravity
should be 0&middot;9. It must have a pure
ammonial odor, and must volatilize without
any residue. It must not become troubled
when mixed with alcohol, or lime water,
otherwise it contains carbonate of ammonia.
Neither must it for the same reason,
become troubled when tested with a solution
of chloride of barium; this is the best
test for carbonate of ammonia. Care is to
be taken to observe the action of the test on
its first addition, for after the mixture has
been exposed to the air for a few minutes,
a troubling necessarily ensues, because the
ammonia abstracts carbonic acid from the
atmosphere.</p>

<p>When super-saturated with nitric acid,
and tested with a solution of <i>nitrate of
silver</i>, it must give no white precipitate;
otherwise it contains sal-ammoniac. It
must give no precipitate with a solution of
chloride of barium, otherwise it contains
sulphuric acid, in which case, the precipitate
will be invisible in nitric acid. It must
give no precipitate with a solution of oxalic
acid or superoxalate of potash; otherwise
it contains lime. When saturated with
nitric acid and tested with a solution of yellow
prussiate of potash, it must give no
precipitate; otherwise it contains copper.
When mixed with its weight of oil of vitriol,
it must not become brown or black; otherwise
it contains empyreumatic oil. As it
is quite difficult to obtain ammonia entirely
free from carbonate of ammonia, or to preserve
it in that state, the employment of
ammonia containing a small portion of the
carbonate is admissible in the practice of
the Daguerreotype.</p>

<h2><a name="DIVISIBILITY_OF_MATTER" id="DIVISIBILITY_OF_MATTER">EXAMPLES OF THE DIVISIBILITY OF MATTER.</a></h2>


<p>All that has been written in support of
what is termed the "Infinite Divisibility of
Matter," has been advanced with an oversight
of certain axiomatic principles which
immediately decide the question in the negative.
Indeed, it would suffice to say that
there can be no such thing as a division of
matter into an infinite number of parts
simply because there can be no such thing
as an infinite number of any thing. Number
is essentially finite, and although, in
imagination, it can be extended indefinitely,
it never can be positively infinite, at any
period of futurity, from the very fact that
we can always conceive of its being extended
still farther. Even as an ideal extension
of parts, it has always a beginning
and an end, at any given time we may
assume for measuring it, and is, therefore,
never infinite in itself at any time. In this
respect it differs essentially from infinite
space, which having no parts, is positively
infinite at all times. Number is a convenient
instrument wherewith to obtain an
idea of infinite space, or of infinite duration,
on account of its capacity for endless
extension or continuation; and it is because
we can ideally extend and continue it forever,
without even approximating to a
measurement of space and duration, that
we discover the latter to be absolutely infinite,
and number to be absolutely finite.
We discover that between the capacity for
endless extension and endless extension
itself, there is a manifest and decided difference.
Under any circumstances, therefore,
the term infinite, as applied to the divisibility
of matter, is unphilosophical and
improper. All the matter in the universe
is finite, and if it were to be doubled, or
quatrilliontupled, every instant of time, to
all eternity, it would never become infinitely
extended. And, by the same rule, it
can never become infinitely subdivided.</p>

<p>If, however, by the term "infinite divisibility," as applied
to matter, is merely
meant its capacity for interminable subdivision,
then the question resolves itself either
into one of speculative fancy or of practical
fact. If the former, then it must be
admitted that, by an effort of the imagination,
we can conceive of such a divisibility
beyond any assignable limits. But if
we regard the question as a practical one,
it immediately becomes too absurd for
serious attention, since it is evident that
human power, limited in all things, must
be so in producing artificial subdivisions of
matter. However unlimited, therefore, the
capacity of matter may be for divisibility,
that of human beings, in relation to it,
must be narrow indeed. When chemists,
therefore, and other philosophers, speak of
the divisibility of the present ultimate
atoms of matter, they must, however unconsciously,
regard them in relation to
human ability, and thus far the question
may become one of experiment. But the
question as to whether matter can actually
be subdivided indefinitely and without
end, is one readily answered in the
negative, by the known inability of mankind
to continue an endless experiment of
this kind. The whole question therefore,
concerning the illimitable divisibility of
matter, which has been discussed from the
earliest period of science to the present
day, is frivolous, fruitless, and irrational.</p>

<p>As matter now exists, not only its ultimate
atoms, but even its constituent molecules,
are as inconceivably minute, as its
aggregations are vast. Taking an exemplification,
from organic matter, we find
that a single drop of a strong solution of indigo,
in which at least 500,000 parts are
rendered distinctly visible by the microscope,
colors 1,000 cubic inches of water,
and as this quantity of water is at least
half a million of times greater than the
drop of indigo solution, the particles of indigo
must be smaller than 2,500,000,000,000, the twenty-five
hundred millionth part
of a cubic inch. If we dissolve a particle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
of silver, of 0.01 of a cubic <i>line</i>, in size, in
nitric acid, it will render distinctly milky
500 cubic inches of a clear solution of common
salt; and, consequently, the magnitude
of each particle of silver thus divided
and diffused, must be somewhat less than
the billionth part of a cubic <i>line!</i> So
great a number as a billion being but imperfectly
conceivable, it may render the
idea of this minute division more distinct,
by stating that to count a single billion of
seconds, by a watch, every day and night
without ceasing, would require 31,675
years. In gilding silver wire, it is found,
by calculation, that a grain of gold is
spread over 1,400 square inches; and as,
when examined by a microscope, the gold
upon the thousandth part of a linear inch
is distinctly visible, it is demonstrated that
gold may be divided into particles of at
least the billionth, 400 millionth, of a
square inch in size, and retain the color and
all other characteristics of a California
prize. If a grain of copper be dissolved in
nitric acid, and then in water of ammonia,
it will give a decidedly violet color to 392
cubic inches of water; and, therefore, if
there was but one particle of copper in
each portion of the water of the size of a
grain of sand, of which one million make
a cubic inch, it would show that the original
grain of copper had become divided
into 392 particles.</p>

<p>This extreme tenuity of matter, however,
is far surpassed in some examples
which may be adduced from organic sources.
It is upon authentic record that an
Irish girl has spun linen yarn, of which
one pound was 1,432 English miles in
length, and of which, therefore, 17 pounds
and 13 ounces would have girt this world;
and yet less than the 127 millionth part of
this thread would have been distinctly
visible, and must have contained other
filaments still finer, each of which must
have been composed of an indefinite number
of smaller particles, themselves, in all probability of complex
organization, and containing certainly, minuter atoms of carbon,
besides those of gaseous matter.</p>

<p>If we employ the microscope, far greater
wonders of divisibility than these appear,
even in the complex organization of animal
life. Ehrenberg has shown that tripoli,
a mineral much used in the arts, is entirely
composed of the siliceous shells of the microscopic
animalcula, known as infusiorials,
and that a single cubic inch of it contains
at least <i>forty-one thousand millions</i> of
these shells!&mdash;about fifty times as many individuals
as there are of human beings on
the globe. Yet each of these minute animals
lived and fed; had digestive and circulative
systems, with blood possessing
globules as large, probably, in proportion,
as those of ours, besides nerves of sensation
and inclination, with brains belonging to
them, together with muscles and every
other mechanical apparatus for the extremely
active locomotion and propagation which
they so interestingly exhibit. And every
new improvement in the microscope reveals
new races of animals, apparently
created for their own enjoyment, and of
which millions heaped on millions, would
be utterly invisible to the unaided eye.&mdash;These
facts prove that things are great and
small only by comparison with each other,
and not in relation to infinity, with which
no comparison can be instituted. And they
prove, moreover, that vain, boastful, and
bigoted man, is not the sole object of creation,
nor of the profound benevolence, contrivance
and design, with which it is universally
replete.&mdash;<i>Art's Echo.</i></p>

<h2><a id="IRON"></a>IRON&mdash;ITS NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL COMBINATIONS WITH CARBON.</h2>

<p>The question is often asked, what constitutes
the difference between wrought iron,
cast iron and steel?</p>

<p>Cast Iron, when viewed under favorable
circumstances, by the help of a microscope
will be found to be a mechanical aggregation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
of molecules of <i>iron and carbon</i>; and
the relative position of these particles may
be illustrated by a pile of cannon balls as
usually arranged in navy yards, each alternate
ball being iron and carbon (charcoal).</p>

<p>If a mass of cast iron be heated until
softened, and then <i>puddled</i> (squeezed), the
carbon will be forced to the surface, and
will there combine with the oxygen of the
atmosphere, forming carbonic acid or
carbonic oxide gases, and thus pass off.
When all the carbon has been parted
with, the mass is called Wrought Iron,
and may then be welded, when at proper
heat, but cannot be melted&mdash;<i>the hottest
blast furnace will not melt wrought iron</i>.
Wrought iron at red heat combines rapidly
with oxygen, and becomes oxide of iron&mdash;thus
a joint of stove-pipe thrown into a furnace
will never melt, but by contact with
atmosphere will change into oxide of iron,
and thus be practically lost. This operation
is technically called <i>burning</i>. If a
piece of wrought iron be surrounded by
carbon (charcoal) finely pulverized, and the
whole enclosed in a sheet iron vessel to exclude
the air, and this placed for a sufficient
length of time in a furnace constructed
for the purpose, the iron will imbibe an
atomic quantity of carbon, and become
Steel. This process is called <i>cementation</i>,
and steel so made can be melted as readily
as cast iron.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that both cast iron
and steel are combinations of iron and carbon,
and in the same proportions, but not
in the same state of combination. In cast
iron, the carbon and iron are a mere <i>mechanical
combination</i>, while in steel the iron
and carbon are combined <i>chemically</i>.&mdash;Wrought
iron, when pure, is free from carbon,
and its ductility, toughness, &amp;c., are
due to the absence of carbon, sulphur, phosphorus,
and other substances, with which
it is occasionally pervaded.</p>

<p>The French chemists are experimenting,
and occasionally succeeding by accident,
in causing heated iron to take the carbon
from carbonic acid and other gases containing
carbon, and thus becoming steel more
rapidly, and at less cost, than when made
by the process of cementation. Mr. Dixon,
of Jersey City, has succeeded in making
steel direct from the Adirondack iron ore,
while Peter Cooper, Esq., Mr. Dickinson,
and others, are manufacturing wrought iron
direct from the iron ores of New-Jersey
without first forming the pig or cast iron,
and of course at less expense, as the saving
of fuel is very great.</p>

<p>The process of <i>case-hardening</i>, or changing
the immediate surface of iron utensils
into steel, is readily performed by covering
their surfaces with such organic substances
as contain carbon as a constituent, and then
subjecting them to high heat for short
spaces of time&mdash;thus the roller of a paper
or sugar mill may be case-hardened by a
coating of prussiate of potash, or of leather
chips, and then subject the whole to high
heat, excluded from atmospheric influences.
By this process the gelatine and other constituents
of the leather are reduced to carbon,
and this enters the surface particles of
the iron, converting them into steel. Many
hypotheses are offered for this action, and
among others, that "<i>the ultimate particles
of matter are always in motion</i>," admitting
the ingress of particles travelling in smaller
orbits between them. The friends of this
hypothesis offer as proof, that a fresh cast
sash-weight when broken is a gray mass,
while one taken from an old building, and
broken, is beautifully crystalline, from the
centre to the outside, like speculum metal.
A freshly drawn piece of tin pipe when
suddenly bent opposite the ear gives no
crackling sound, and if broken has no
crystalline structure, but if left at rest for
one hour it has both. Barbers often tell us
that razors get tired of shaving, but if laid
by for thirty days they will then shave well.
By microscopic examination it is found that
the <i>tired razor</i>, from long stropping by the
same hand and in the same directions, has
the ultimate particles or fibres of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
surface or edge all arranged in one direction,
like the edge of a piece of cut velvet; but
after a month's rest, these fibres re-arrange
themselves heterogeneously, crossing each
other and presenting a saw-like edge, each
fibre supporting its fellow, and hence cutting
the beard, instead of being forced down
flat without cutting, as when laid by.
These and many other instances are offered
by the friends of the hypothesis named, to
prove that the ultimate particles of matter
are always in motion, and they say that in
the process of welding, the absolute momentum
of the hammer causes an entanglement
of orbits of motion, and hence a
re-arrangement, as in one piece; indeed,
in the cold state, a leaf of gold laid on a
polished surface of steel, and stricken
smartly with a hammer, will have its particles
forced into the steel so as to permanently
gild it at the point of contact.</p>

<p>The oxidation of metals is equally curious,
and the length of time necessary for the
formation of an infinitesimal coating of oxide
is less than the one-thousandth of a
second. This fact may be readily proved:
a clean surface of steel, free from oxide,
when brought in contact with mercury
(quicksilver) will amalgamate, but if the
least oxide be upon the surface no such effect
will take place. Prepare a trough
containing quicksilver, and place a bar of
steel above it, and within one inch or less
of the surface of the quicksilver&mdash;break
this bar with a smart blow from a hammer,
so that the blow which breaks it shall at
the same time force the broken ends into
the quicksilver, and although the time occupied
by the ends in passing through one
inch of atmosphere before reaching the surface
of the quicksilver will be immeasurably
short, still they will be so oxidized as
not to amalgamate with the mercury; if,
however, the bar of steel be confined at its
ends below the surface of the quicksilver,
and then be broken <i>upwards</i>, by a lever applied
to its centre, the ends of the broken
bar will be beautifully amalgamated before reaching the
atmosphere above. The
reason for the success of the last named experiment is
doubtless due to the absence of
oxide of iron, when broken beneath the
surface of the mercury. <span class="smcap">J. J. MAPES.</span></p>

<h2><a name="QUICK_STUFFS" id="QUICK_STUFFS">QUICK STUFFS.</a></h2>


<p>We have endeavored to guard against
giving useless receipts, thereby saving our
Daguerreotypes a tax which would prove
in most instances of no benefit. As many
have requested us to publish a variety of
receipts for Quicks. We give them with
but little comment. We will number each
combination:</p>

<p>No. 1. Take pure rain or distilled water,
one quart filtered through paper into a bottle
having a ground glass stopper, and add
one and a half ounces of chloride of iodine
for warm weather, or little less for cold
weather. The reason of this is obvious,
from the fact that during the warm
summer day, the bromine is far more volatile
than in a winter day. To the above
add one ounce of best American bromine,
and shake well. Now, with care, to prevent,
as far as possible, the escape of gas,
add, drop by drop, thirty drops of aqua
ammonia, shaking well the mixture at
each drop.</p>

<p>It is necessary that caution be observed,
and not add more at a time than three
drops of the aqua ammonia, as otherwise it
evolves too much heat.</p>

<p><i>Use.</i> Put in the box one part quick to
eight parts water. Coat to dark yellow
over dry iodine, and change to a deep
rosed color over the Quick; recoat over
iodine one-tenth.</p>

<p>No. 2. Lime water, one quart; chloride
iodine, one ounce; add three-fourths of an
ounce of bromine&mdash;shake well.</p>

<p><i>Use.</i> Put in box one part quick to six
water; coat to bright yellow over iodine;
to rose over the quick, and recoat one-fourth.</p>

<p>No. 3. Take rain or distilled water, one
quart; add pulverized alum until it is a
little sour to the taste; and a small piece,
say one half inch square, of magnesia,&mdash;Filter
through paper, and add chloride of
iodine, one half ounce; bromine sufficient
to take it up, which is a little less than
half an ounce.</p>

<p><i>Use.</i> One part quick to six parts water;
coat over iodine to a soft yellow, nearly,
but not quite bordering on a rose; over the
quick to a dark purple or steel; recoat from
one-sixth to one-tenth.</p>

<p>The above works slow, but with a good
light and proper management it can be
made to produce as good impression as any
combination known, yet it is not so easily
managed as No. 1.</p>

<p>No. 4. Rain or distilled water, one gallon;
bromine, one and a half drachm; sulphuric
acid, two and a half drachms; hydrochloric
acid,<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> two drachms.&mdash;Shake
well as each is added in the above order.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> This acid dissolves glass with great rapidity.
It is purchased in leaden bottles. A single drop
on the skin would make a sore difficult to heal.
Daguerreotypists should bear in mind that the
accelerating chemicals used in the Daguerreian
art, are of the most volatile substance, and more
difficult to experiment with than all other in the
range of chemical science. When hydrofluoric
acid is to be measured, the graduated glass should
be partly filled with the mixture to which you intend
adding it.</p></div>

<p><i>Use.</i> To one ounce water, add from fifteen
to thirty drops quick; coat over an incipient
rose; over quick, nearly change the
color to fair rose; recoat about one-third or
one-fourth as long as at first coating. The
coating box should be charged strong
enough to change the plate in from <i>one</i> to
<i>four seconds</i>. One advantage this mixture
possesses, it will work in one-half the time
required for any of the foregoing combinations.
One very serious objection to its
use is, it cannot, without great care, be
made to work with certainty; and another
objection is, it will not last long, as the box
will require to be replenished after having
coated from <i>eight</i> to <i>fourteen</i> plates. The
older, however, this mixture is, the more
certain in its operation. We have one
gallon which has been made <i>two years</i>.</p>

<p>No. 5. <i>Dry Quick.</i> We have already
given this preparation in a former number
of this Journal.</p>

<p>No. 6. <i>Acidulated Quick.</i> Water, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
pint: bromine, ten drops; chloride of iodine,
forty drops; nitro-muriatic acid, one-fourth
ounce; sulphuric acid, two drops.</p>

<p><i>Use.</i> One part quick to ten parts water;
coat over iodine to orange; over quick to
rose red; recoat one-fourth.</p>

<p>There are thousands of different combinations
and agents employed, and, after all,
let every Daguerreian make up his mind
to first <i>become acquainted</i> with some <i>good</i>
combination of bromine and iodine, there
will be less complaining of <i>Quicks</i>.</p>

<p>W. O. R., Mo., Mr. R. writes&mdash;"Will you have
the kindness to inform me of any new process
for preparing phosphate of iron. I make the request
more particularly to obtain a process by one
Mr. Routh, who I understand has a new process."</p>

<p>The preparation referred to by Mr. R., was read
before the London Medical Society, January 11,
1851, by Dr. Routh, at which time he exhibited
specimens of phosphate of iron made by dissolving
the ordinary phosphate in meta-phosphoric
acid, and by then evaporating to degrees. It has
been found that this form of iron is exceedingly
useful in cases where iron is desired.</p>

<p>W. B. N., Mexico&mdash;Mr. N. says&mdash;"Will some
of your subscribers give, through your Journal, a
practical and first-rate process for producing
Calotypes?"</p>

<p>We hope some of our "subscribers" will furnish
the same.</p>

<p>H. B. T., Ohio.&mdash;Mr. T. says&mdash;"Will you give
a ready and easy method of detecting chlorine? I
find in a former number of your valuable Journal,
that you have been making experiments with
this gas. I have had remarkable success with
this gas, although not a practical Daguerreotypist."</p>

<p>Mr. J. will find 'this gas' is readily distinguished
from other gases by its color, odor, and bleaching
properties. Probably the most simple method of
detecting free chloride is to hold a rod dipped in
aqua ammonia over it, when white fumes will be
formed.</p>

<p>Will Mr. J. have the kindness to forward to us
his experiments&mdash;we would like much to lay them
before our readers.</p>

<p>A Stock Dealer, in one of the Southern States,
writes&mdash;"What articles of stock will be less
needed by artists, provided Mr. Hill's process
proves true, of producing pictures with all the
'colors of nature?'"</p>

<p><i>Colors and brushes!</i></p>

<p>J. W. S , Mich.&mdash;We forwarded the article you
ordered, and enclosed the balance in the package.
The view camera you had better order soon, as it
will be some time before Mr. Harrison can get it
ready, he having so many orders now on hand.
You had better have one of Lewis's <i>new</i> Camera
boxes.</p>

<p>T. J. C., Va.&mdash;We cannot recommend the articles
you speak of; they involve only an old
vague principle, and are only worthy the person
having them in charge.</p>

<p>A. G. L., Pa.&mdash;The money received and forwarded
to Europe&mdash;your plan may work, but it
looks a little too "opaque." You will find by
heating an iron plate, and applying it to your apparatus,
will facilitate the operation much. Chapman
has the exclusive right to the patent.</p>

<p>E. W., Miss.&mdash;See page 24, Daguerreian Journal.</p>

<p>This valuable Medical Journal is fast making
its way into the medical ranks with marked

and we are happy to see that with us it is
prosperous; every number is received and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
read with pleasure. We find the following
pithy notice in the Register, which is only
one of many from the cute pen of the Editor,
who it seems has 'cut up' as well as
received a "New Dido." "We were presented
with the first number of the "New
Dido" by the publisher, and from the title,
at first supposed that it might be in some
way connected with the medical profession,
inasmuch as some 'pranks' in a medical
way have been 'cut up' in poetry, but in
looking it over, we find that a couple of
'chaps' have started off for a drive, although
what they are 'driving at,' the
author has not yet disclosed. We think it
likely enough they may "turn out" students,
for they are evidently after subjects,
which no doubt will be brought to light
in the next number."&mdash;Good, Dr., that is
worth the Dollar for the subscription.</p>

number, which has a fine likeness of Dr.
John W. Francis.</p>

"Those acquainted with the Christian character,

operating of the most simple and scientific character.
The Book will be a treasure to those engaged

recommend it to the Daguerreian fraternity."</p>

It is so constructed that it will hold the plate

<p class="caption3nb">POSTAGE ON THE DAGUERREIAN JOURNAL</p>

<p>THERE has been a few instances where Postmasters
have charged pamphlet postage on this
Journal. We say the Daguerreian Journal is
"subject to newspaper postage only," because that
is all that can legally be charged on it. A newspaper
must be published as often as "once a
month," and contain intelligence of passing events.</p>

<p>This publication is semi-monthly, and contains,
a general summary of "passing events." The law
says it may contain two sheets, if the two together
do not exceed 1,900 square inches. This Journal
contains less than 1,100 square inches. These
sheets may be folded in any shape, or printed on
paper of any color. The following is an extract
from the Act of Congress for regulating postage.</p>

<p>"A newspaper is defined to be any printed publication
issued in numbers, and published at stated
intervals of not more than a month, conveying
intelligence of passing events. It generally consists
of a sheet, but may be composed of two
sheets of paper. In such case, it is chargeable
with newspaper postage only; provided that the
sheets in the aggregate do not exceed 1,900 square
inches.</p>

<p>"A pamphlet is a small, unbound, printed
book."</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
